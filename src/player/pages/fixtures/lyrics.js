[00:00.01]Find your dreams come true
[00:04.01]And I wonder if you know
[00:08.58]What it means, what it means
[00:14.12]And I wonder if you know
[00:18.89]What it means, what it means
[00:24.27]And I wonder if you know
[00:28.78]What it means to find your dreams
[00:35.08]I've been waiting on this my whole life
[00:45.37]These dreams be waking me up at night
[00:55.21]You say I think I'm never wrong
[01:05.46]You know what, maybe you're right, aight
[01:14.50]And I wonder if you know
[01:19.02]What it means, what it means
[01:24.30]And I wonder if you know
[01:29.06]What it means to find your dreams
[01:35.58]You say he get on your fucking nerves
[01:45.12]You hope that he get what he deserves, word
[01:55.43]Do you even remember what the issue is
[01:58.22]You just trying to find where the tissue is
[02:00.99]You can still be who you wish you is
[02:03.00]It ain't happen yet
[02:04.27]And that's what the intuition is
[02:06.26]When you hop back in the car
[02:07.77]Drive back to the crib
[02:08.77]Run back to their arms
[02:10.27]The smokescreens
[02:11.53]The chokes and the screams
[02:13.03]You ever wonder what it all really mean
[02:15.30]And I wonder if you know
[02:19.06]What it means, what it means
[02:24.59]And I wonder if you know
[02:29.36]What it means to find your dreams
[02:36.38]And I'm back on my grind
[02:38.90]A psychic read my lifeline
[02:40.66]Told me in my lifetime
[02:41.92]My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
[02:44.43]And that's what I'm
[02:46.19]Seven O'clock, that's primetime
[02:47.94]Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
[02:50.95]Why he keep giving me hot lines
[02:53.74]I'm a star, how could I not shine
[02:55.75]How many ladies in the house
[02:57.50]How many ladies in the house without a spouse
[03:00.28]Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
[03:03.82]What you about
[03:05.83]On that independent shit
[03:08.58]Trade it all for a husband and some kids
[03:10.84]You ever wonder what it all really mean
[03:13.35]You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams
